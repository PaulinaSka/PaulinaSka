My Journey: From Down Under to Up-and-Comer
Let’s rewind a bit. Picture this: I’m in Australia, soaking up the sun and studying to be an architect. Dreaming of designing skyscrapers, I somehow end up designing ships and submarines. Because, why not? It’s like architecture, but wetter.

Fast forward a few years, and I decide to trade the sunny shores of Oz for the charming drizzle of the UK. Who wouldn’t swap Bondi Beach for a good cup of tea, right? 

In between dodging sheep and navigating roundabouts, I discover a few things: a love for foraging (because nature’s grocery store is free), painting (because blank canvases don’t talk back), and coding (because apparently, designing submarines wasn’t complicated enough). Oh, and let’s not forget my fascination with physics and astronomy—because staring at the stars and contemplating the universe is the perfect way to spend an evening.

Somewhere along the line, I realise that while submarines are cool, the world of tech is calling my name. So, I dive headfirst into full stack development, because what could go wrong when you mix a love for nature, art, and lines of code? Spoiler alert: a lot, but it’s all part of the fun.

These days, when I’m not elbow-deep in code, I’m probably out in the woods, pretending to be a contestant on a very low-budget survival show, painting landscapes or looking at the stars through a telescope muttering to myself about physics.

So, what exactly do I bring to the table? A quirky mix of leadership, software engineering, web development, jokes and puns, APIs, testing, full stack wizardry, product management, a deep love of physics and astronomy, and an uncanny ability to spot the difference between a mushroom that’s good in a risotto and one that will make you see unicorns.
In short, I design, I code, I paint, I forage, I stargaze, and I occasionally look at a ship and think, “I used to design those.” All in a day’s work.
